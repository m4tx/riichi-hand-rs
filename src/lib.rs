//! A collection of utilities for working with Riichi Mahjong player hands.
//!
//! This currently includes:
//! * Hand representation object
//! * Parser that allows to quickly create a hand using human-readable string, such as
//!     `123m456p_7*77z`
//! * Renderer that allows to draw a hand to a raster image (along with a few ready-to-use
//!     sets of tile images)
//!
//! ## Feature flags
//! By default, all the crate features are enabled. You can disable some of them on demand to save
//! on the compilation time and resulting library size.
//!
//! * `raster-renderer` - renderer for hands that outputs raster images
//! * `fluffy-stuff-tile-sets` - ready-to-use tile sets based on FluffyStuff's work. Greatly
//!     increases build time
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```
//! use riichi_hand::parser::HandParser;
//! use riichi_hand::raster_renderer::fluffy_stuff_tile_sets::YELLOW_FLUFFY_STUFF_TILE_SET;
//! use riichi_hand::raster_renderer::{RasterRenderer, RenderOptions};
//!
//! let hand = HandParser::parse("123m123p123sEESS").unwrap();
//! let image = RasterRenderer::render(&hand, &*YELLOW_FLUFFY_STUFF_TILE_SET, RenderOptions::default()).unwrap();
//! image.save("/tmp/hand.png").unwrap();
//! ```
